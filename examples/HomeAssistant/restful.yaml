# This is an example how to use the RESTful integration that comes with Home Assistant
# to define entities that get their values from polling zenSDK locally on your device.

rest:
  - resource: http://espressif/properties/report    # edit the hostname for HA to reach your device
    sensor:
      - name: "Zendure SolarFlow Solar Input"
        value_template: "{{ value_json['properties']['solarInputPower'] }}"
        device_class: power
        unit_of_measurement: W
        unique_id: solarflow_solarInputPower   # you can change this to include deviceId for uniqueness
      - name: "Zendure SolarFlow Home Output"
        value_template: "{{ value_json['properties']['outputHomePower'] }}"
        device_class: power
        unit_of_measurement: W
        unique_id: solarflow_outputHomePower
      - name: "Zendure SolarFlow Battery Level"
        value_template: "{{ value_json['properties']['electricLevel'] }}"

# a rest_command is used to write zenSDK settings
# this can then be used in automations
# you have the send the value to set as well as the serial number for authentication
# as "data" to the commands

# the automations are defined in automations.yaml

# we can then use an input slider that will be connected to the property via automations
